<p>What is a Nomad? Well, according to the dictionary,

nomad
noun

1. a member of a people that travels from place to place to find fresh pasture for its animals and has no permanent home

Example: the withering of their grasslands forced the nomads of the Sahara to descend into the Nile valley

But I like to say that it's more than just that.</p>
